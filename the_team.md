## The team

We are five students from St Andrews that come from around the world and all have an interest in competitive programming. 

Fun fact: none of us are doing single-honours Computer Science - *all* study joint-honours CS and (mostly) Maths.

*Currently under construction. Feel free to upload a photo of yours if this is something you are comfortable with.*
