## Who are we?

We are a small group of St Andrews students whose main intention is to improve our algorithmic and problem solving skills. This will prepare one for competitive programming competitions as well as help one ace technical coding interviews.

## The contest

It is a weekly programming competition (of approxmately one hour) where you solve fun and interesting programming problems. One of us typically sets the problems for that week.

### Past contests

They can be found [here](/Competitions). Analysis, and in some cases, solutions and editorials can be found there. If not here, they can be found on the contest page itself (under the "Editorial" section), where test cases can also be downloaded.

### Past winners

The leaderboard for each contest can be found on the contest page itself.

### Support and sponsorships

In the past, we have worked with hackathons like Hack Quarantine ([Contest 11](/Competitions/Competition%2011%20%5B29%20March%202020%5D/readme.md) and [Contest 12](/Competitions/Competition%2012%20[5%20Apr%202020]/readme.md)) and The Open Code Foundation ([Contest 19](/Competitions/Competition%2019%20[24%20May%202020]/readme.md)). 

Upon request, we can create custom contests for hackathons and organisations, and possibly provide other support as well (like workshops and talks). For more information about us and for potential sponsorship opportunities, feel free to email dm282@st-andrews.ac.uk.

### The team

Currently consists of five St Andrews students from around the world. Learn more about the members that power this club [here](the_team.md).
