# Competitive Programming St Andrews Beta

This repository contains the resources and questions from past contests, held weekly from 2-3PM UK Time on HackerRank.

**We are now part of [STACS](https://www.facebook.com/StACompSoc)**. Our events will continue normally, but this means that every STACS member is officially a part of CPSTA. There are other benefits as well.

**Accessibility issues?** If you have a condition (eg visually impaired, or even otherwise) that you think is causing you difficulty in taking part in any of our our events or contests, please let cpsta@st-andrews.ac.uk know. We'll do what we can to ensure that you can take part in all our events.

## Who are we?

We are a small group of St Andrews students whose main intention is to improve our algorithmic and problem solving skills. This will prepare one for competitive programming competitions as well as help one ace technical coding interviews. We are open to all irrespecitve of major or coding experience - the point is to learn and improve.

## The contest

It is a weekly programming competition (of approximately one hour) where you solve fun and interesting programming problems. One of us typically sets the problems for that week.

### Past contests

They can be found [here](/Competitions). Analysis, and in some cases, solutions and editorials can be found there. If not here, they can be found on the contest page itself (under the "Editorial" section), where test cases can also be downloaded.

### Past winners

The leaderboard for each contest can be found on the contest page itself.

### Support and sponsorships

In the past, we have worked with hackathons like Hack Quarantine ([Contest 11](/Competitions/Competition%2011%20%5B29%20March%202020%5D/readme.md) and [Contest 12](/Competitions/Competition%2012%20[5%20Apr%202020]/readme.md)) and The Open Code Foundation ([Contest 19](/Competitions/Competition%2019%20[24%20May%202020]/readme.md)). 

Upon request, we can create custom contests for hackathons and organisations, and possibly provide other support as well (like workshops and talks). For more information about us and for potential sponsorship opportunities, feel free to email cpsta@st-andrews.ac.uk.
