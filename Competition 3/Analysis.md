## Overall comments

This competition had significantly more participation than the previous one.
Overall, it went smoothly, with virtually all contestants being able to gain some level of points.
Like in the previous contest, partial marking was enabled and the majority of marks were gained in this way, with few (if any) fully perfect answers being given to many questions.

One question was written by the contest setter, with the other five questions selected from the Hackerrank archives.

Number of contestants who made a submission: 10 <br>
Highest score: 343.79/750 (45.8%)<br> 
Lowest score: 44.44/750 (5.9%)<br>
Mean: 202.82/750 (27%)<br>
Median: 200/750 (26.7%)<br>
Mode: 100/750 (13.3%)
## Question 1 - Prime Seating (100)

Highest score: 100/100 <br>
Lowest score: 44.44/100 <br>
Number of attempts: 10

This problem was intended to be very accessible, as even a brute force solution which checked all of the numbers from 2 to (n-1) inclusive for factors of n would pass all test cases.
The overwhelming majority of contestants got this right.

## Question 2 - Drawing Book (100)

Highest score: 100/100 <br>
Lowest score: 52/100 <br>
Number of attempts: 7

This problem was selected from Hackerrank's archives. It was intended to cover the 'ad hoc' type of programming contest problem, as no classical algorithmic or data structure techniques were required to answer it. Over half the people who attempted it got it right, however, it did slow down many contestants due to edge cases and off-by-one errors.

## Question 3 - Lily's Homework (125)

Highest score: 37.50/125 (30%) <br>
Lowest score: 12.50/125 (10%) <br>
Number of attempts: 2

This problem could also be considered to be an 'ad hoc' problem, but it required the contestants to use a sorting algorithm.
I expected this problem to be less accesssible than the previous ones, but I (incorrectly) assumed that those with competitive programming experience
would be able to solve it completely.

## Question 4 - Sherlock and the Valid String (125)
Highest score: 110.30/125 (88.2%)<br>
Lowest score: 88.25/125 (70.6%) <br>
Number of attempts: 4

This systematic string searching problem received more submissions than Question 3.
The scores seen seem to indicate that most contestants were well aware of the strategic advantage
given by just taking whatever points they could, as opposed to trying to get a perfect score on a problem.
While this is almost certainly a highly effective strategy for one-hour contests with partial scoring, I suspect
that it might not be a very effective practicing technique for competitive programming in general.

## Question 5 - Subest Component (150)
Highest score: n/a <br>
Lowest score: n/a <br>
Number of attempts: 0/Unknown

This was a combinatorics and graph theory problem chosen to test those with a significant amount of competitive programming
experience. Judging by the lack of submissions, it is clear that this was too difficult for a one hour contest.

## Question 6 - String Reduction (150)
Highest score: 0 <br>
Lowest score: 0 <br>
Number of attempts: 0

This was a dynamic programming problem. Like Question 5, it was chosen to test those with a significant amount of competitive
programming experience - this had more attempts than the other question, though. Perhaps due to graph theory problems tending to have
relatively lengthy solutions.
