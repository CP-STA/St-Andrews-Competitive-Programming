This question, like all of the first questions in our contests, was
designed to be quite approachable. This was reflected in its 100%
success rate. It could be solved using string
manipulation functions from most standard libraries, or with a linear search.

## Question 2 - Wall Off The Natural (10)

Highest score: 10/10 (100%) <br>
Lowest score: 0.53/10 (5.3%) <br>
Mean: 8/10 (80%) <br>
Median: 10/10 (100%) <br>

Number of contestants who attempted: 5

This question was a problem in inspired by the 'fence painting' post on GeeksForGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painting-fence-algorithm/).
It was intended to be solved with a bottom-up 
dynamic programming approach (and this was the
safest way of getting to the solution, in the
sense that this method tended to be the easiest
to avoid bugs with), however, it could also
be solved with a recursive approach.

## Question 3 - Nydus Network (30)

Highest score: 0/15 (0%)<br>
Lowest score: 0/15 (0%)<br>
Mean: 0/15 (0%) <br>
Median: 0/15 (0%)<br>
Mode: 0/15 (0%)<br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 1

This question was intended to test contestants'
knowledge of graph theory. It could be solved
by implementing any minimum spanning tree algorithm. While it was not solved during the contest, a correct solution in Python was submitted minutes after it ended.
