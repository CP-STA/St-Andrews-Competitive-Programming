Number of contestants who made a submission: 22 <br>
Highest score: 15/15 (100%) <br>
Lowest score: 0/15 (0%)<br>
Mean: 7.79/15 (51.89%) <br>
Median: 7.5/15 (50%) <br>

## Question 1 - A: Gauss (5)

Highest score: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Lowest score: 0/5 (0%) <br>
Mean: 4.77/5 (95.46%) <br>
Median: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Mode: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 22

This question was intended to be the most
approachable of the three questions. It was
intended to be solved using a formula for the
sum of an arithmetic series, though correct
solutions using built-in library functions to
add together the numbers in a range were
also submitted.

## Question 2 - B: Kasparov (5)

Highest score: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Lowest score: 0/5 (0%) <br>
Mean: 3.44/5 (68.75%) <br>
Median: 5/5 (100%), 4.75/5 (95%) <br>
Mode: 5/5(100%), 4.75/5 (95%) <br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 12

This question was an implementation question
that required contestants to represent the
chessboard and determine a way of counting
the number of queens attacking each square.
Given the constraints, the most straightforward
way of doing this was just to store a value for
each square and iterate through every queen, increasing this value for each square that
the queen attacks. Generally, this was what
high-scoring solutions did. One of the testcases
had an error which was fixed late in the contest,
causing several correct solutions to only score
4.75/5 - as the problem setter, I apologise for this.

## Question 3 - C: Sparrow (5)

Highest score: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Lowest score: 0/5 (0%) <br>
Mean: 3.57/5 (71.43%) <br>
Median: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Mode: 5/5 (100%) <br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 7

This question was a graph theory problem which
required contestants to program a depth first traversal. Given that this is fairly 'textbook',
this question had a considerably higher success
rate than Question 2, with the majority of
submissions scoring full marks.
