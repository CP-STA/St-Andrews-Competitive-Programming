* Highest score: 30/30 
* Lowest score: 1.88/30
* Mean: 13.96
* Number of attempts: 7
* Difficulty: Easy  

This question was the second most popular question in the contest. 4 contestants managed to score a perfect 30/30. It was expected to be a question that would be easy to solve if one had knowledge of Hashmaps but at the same time designed not be too complicated for those without prior experience. Hopefully contestants can use this question as a stepping point to understand Hashmaps and possible use cases for them.

## Question 3: Island Sizes

Link to challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/competitive-programming-st-andrews-beta-contest-37/challenges/island-sizes

* Highest score: 40/40 
* Lowest score: 0/40
* Mean: 26.66/40
* Number of attempts: 3
* Difficulty: Medium 

This question was the hardest of the three although would have been straight forward for people who have solved similar problems before. The question was testing basic DFS and recursion skills. It was intended to be a refresher for people who hav solved problems like number of islands, max area of islands etc before. At the same time this question was included to expose new contestants to such a question as it can turn up quite often in coding interviews. It was good to see multiple successful solutions during the contest. The scoring for this question was binary (0 or 40) to ensure that only completely correct solutions can gain points.
