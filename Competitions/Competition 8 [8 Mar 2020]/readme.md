## Overall comments

This competition had a very low level of participation, perhaps mostly due to
other CS-related events occurring the same weekend. However, those who did participate
were presented with three relatively challenging problems which resulted in the average
score being quite low.

There turned out to be an issue with the test cases for problem 3, which will be fixed
in the near future. Although this problem was not attempted by any participants during the
contest itself, the problem setter sincerely apologises for this.

All three problems were written by the contest setter.

Number of contestants who made a submission: 4 <br>
Highest score: 100/450 (22.2%)<br>
Lowest score: 0.00/450 (0.0%)<br>
Mean: 50.83/450 (11.3%)<br>
Median: 51.67/450 (11.5%)<br>
Mode: N/A (All scores were unique)

## Question 1 - CACTUS (100)

Highest score: 100/100 <br>
Lowest score: 0.00/100 <br>
Mean: 61.11/100 <br>
Number of attempts: 3

This problem was admittedly a bit ambitious for a first problem. It was intended to be solved
using a basic dynamic programming technique, building a 2D array or list which stores the answer
for a given cell and then printing out the value in the bottom right cell. It was actually
possible to score a significant number of the available points by just printing out '0', though.

## Question 2 - HOME (150)

Highest score: 10/150 <br>
Lowest score: 10/150 <br>
Mean: 10/150 <br>
Number of attempts: 2

This problem was considered to be more accessible than problem 1, however, it was significantly more 'wordy'.
Fully correct solutions were given outside of contest time, and worked more or less in the same manner as the
editorial code (systematically finding or generating numbers of the types required and then matching them).

## Question 3 - Monster (200)

Highest score: 0/200<br>
Lowest score: 0/200 <br>
Mean: 0/200 <br>
Number of attempts: 0

This problem was quite mathematical in nature. That said, it turned out to have faulty test cases during the
contest and due to the difficulty of questions 1 and 2, this question did not have any impact on the final results.
The editorial code and test cases will be fixed soon and this analysis subsequently be updated.
