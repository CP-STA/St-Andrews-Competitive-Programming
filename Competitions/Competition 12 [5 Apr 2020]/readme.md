## Overall comments

This competition was meant to be slightly more approachable than previous
contests, but was hampered by an error in the solution algorithm of
question 2, and an error in one of the test cases of question 3. These
issues have since been fixed, but I, the problem setter, sincerely
apologise for both these mistakes and the fact that I did not
manage to correct them during the contest time when concerns were raised.

This question was designed to be an approachable starting problem which required little more than a some knowledge of basic physics. One liner solutions were possible, and were indeed seen in submissions.

## Question 2 - CROWN (75)

The solution code for this question had a fundamental flaw (essentially, the solution code used to generate the test cases did not appropriately handle 'palindromic numbers' with leading zeroes) which resulted in all of the test cases being unsolvable even with a correct submission. This issue has since been fixed. Once again, I apologise for this oversight.

## Question 3 - MIROH (100)

Highest score: 87.5/100 <br>
Lowest score: 62.5/100 <br>
Mean: 82.5/100
Median: 87.5/100
Mode: 87.5/100
Number of contestants who attempted: 5

This problem was quite simple for those with a knowledge of the flood
fill algorithm. However, there was an error with one of the test cases
making it impossible for a correct submission to score full marks. I
apologise for this, and have corrected the error.
