* Highest score: 20/20 
* Lowest score: 20/20
* Mean: 20
* Number of attempts: 7
* Difficulty: Easy  

All contestants managed to solve this question and secure full points. It was indeed intended to be the easiest question in the contest. In this question one needs to observe a pattern with the number of spaces that should be printed in each line. It is also important to notice that the number of items in a row is determined by the number itself.Â

# Question 3: 7_11_13

Link to challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/competitive-programming-st-andrews-beta-contest-32/challenges/7-11-13

* Highest score: 40/40 
* Lowest score: 0/40
* Mean: 19.67/40
* Number of attempts: 3
* Difficulty: Medium 

The setter expected more attempts with this question (especially brute force attempts). The brute force solution will time out with larger cases and involves iterating over numbers from 1 to 10^9 and checking if it only contains 7, 11 or 13 as its factors. A more optimal solution uses previous results to generate new results and pops them out one by one. A heap is useful in this case as one can get the smallest element each time we iterate.
