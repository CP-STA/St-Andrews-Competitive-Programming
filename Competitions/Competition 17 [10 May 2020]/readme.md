### Overview:

The contest was made in a short amount of time, therefore, the time limit restriction was not suitable. The question can be solved using a brute force method which does not follow our team objective. I want to apologise for the unfairness. I hope that everyone still enjoys the contest.

### Question 3 - Nancy and candies

Unfortunately, the problem can be solved by brute force, which does not reflect the difficulty level as indicated by the tag. Although it is too late, I will change the time limit in case you want to improve efficiency.
