# Contest 52 Analysis

*Setter: Leaderboard*

## Overall comments

This contest was well done, despite a nasty bug in Q1 that caused confusion for the first 10 minutes, which is regretted. Q2 was the separator as expected. Two users got a perfect mark of 80/80, well done to them.

It's rare that I see solutions that are completely different to what I was expecting, but one user managed to do that for both Q2 and Q3. I'm going to call out Jonathan Yim for pulling that off, well done!
