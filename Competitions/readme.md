# Competitions

This page lists the competitions that were held till now, together with relevant analysis (and solutions in some cases) for each problem and the contest in general. Note that the test cases (and the solutions) can also be found in HackerRank in many cases.

Editorials are mostly found in the contest page itself on HackerRank, or can alternatively be found here.

**Curious on the stats?** You can compare the statistics of previous contests [here](statistics.md).
