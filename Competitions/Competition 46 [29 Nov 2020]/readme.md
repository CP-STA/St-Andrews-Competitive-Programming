## Question 1:Majority Digits


Link to Challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/competitive-programming-st-andrews-beta-contest-46/challenges/majority-digits/problem


* Highest score: 20/20 
* Lowest score: 20/20
* Mean: 20/20
* Number of attempts: 5
* Difficulty: Easy 

This question was intended to be the easiest problem in the contest and it was correctly solved by all 5 participants. The solution is straightforward if one knows how to iterate over each character in a string and count certain kinds of characters. The fastest solution for this problem was by leaderboard, only 2 minutes and 38 seconds after starting the contest.

## Question 2: Sum of K Consecutive Equals N

Link to challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/competitive-programming-st-andrews-beta-contest-46/challenges/sum-of-k-consecutive-equals-n

* Highest score: 40/40 
* Lowest score: 33/40
* Mean: 38.25/40
* Number of attempts: 4
* Difficulty: Medium   

Three contestants managed to score a perfect 40/40 while one missed out on 2 of the smaller test cases. As discussed in the editorial, this problem can have multiple solutions and the most optimal solution can actually be achieved in constant time. It was good to see most participants doing well on this question resulting in a high contest mean. It is worth noting that as K <= 10^5, an O(K) solution did achieve full points.

## Question 3: LEU-KGX 9

Link to challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/competitive-programming-st-andrews-beta-contest-46/challenges/leu-kgx-9


* Highest score: 0/40 
* Lowest score: 0/40
* Mean: 0/40
* Number of attempts: 3
* Difficulty: Medium 

This question was the hardest of the 3. It was expected that the more experienced participants will be able to solve the question as it is similar to the classical coin change problem where P can denote the amount of change that needs to be given and voucher_point_values denotes the denominations of coins available. This question was also designed keeping in mind that some contestants may not be very familiar with dynamic programming and such a problem can be a good example of where DP can be applied to speed things up.
