This question, like all of the first questions in our contests, was
designed to be quite approachable. This was reflected in its 100%
success rate. It was intended to be solved with a greedy approach -
immediately sending drones to mine from the closest mineral patches.
The greatest difficulty in the problem was probably in the implementation,
and solutions tended to require more lines of code than our average Q1 solutions.

## Question 2 - Mutalisks (25)

Highest score: 3.13/25 (12.52%) <br>
Lowest score: 3.13/25 (12.52%) <br>
Mean: 3.13/25 (12.52%) <br>
Median: 3.13/25 (12.52%) <br>
Mode: 3.13/25 (12.52%) <br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 4

This question was a disguised decanting problem, where the lair and hive
represented two jugs and the Mutalisks represented water. The main difficulty appeared to be in identifying this - no correct solutions
were submitted during contest time. While the opaqueness of the problem
statement was somewhat intended, it did make this question the
hardest one of the three, statistically.

## Question 3 - Nydus Network (30)

Highest score: 30/30 (100%)<br>
Lowest score: 0/30 (0%)<br>
Mean: 20/30 (66.67%) <br>
Median: 30/30 (100%)<br>
Mode: 30/30 (100%)<br>
Number of contestants who attempted: 3

This question required contestants to implement an algorithm which
finds strongly connected components within directed graphs, such as
Kosaraju's Algorithm or Tarjan's Algorithm. Contestants who had
knowledge of these algorithms beforehand seemed to be able to solve
this comfortably, however, the question appeared to be harder for contestants who did not have this knowledge before the contest.
