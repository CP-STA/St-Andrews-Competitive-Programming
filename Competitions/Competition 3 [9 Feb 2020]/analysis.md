## Statistic

* Total signup: 24 (included 2 signups after the end of contest)
* Total participate in contest: 13

## Question 1: String evaluation (easy)

### During contest
* Total submissions: 13
* Success rate: 100% (13/13)
* Fastest solver: philip\_a\_searcy (+1min)
* Languages used: Python3, Java8, Cpp14

### After contest
* Total submissions: 2
* Success rate: 100% (2/2)

**Comment:** No comment.

## Question 2: skyfall (medium)

### During contest
* Total submissions: 33
* Success rate: 0% (0/33)
	** Error count**
	* Wrong answers: 25
	* Terminate due to timeout: 21
	* Compilation error: 2
	* runtime error: 24
* Best solution: philip\_a\_searcy
* Languages used: Python3, Java8, Cpp14

### After contest
* Total submussions: 8
* Success rate: 25% (2/8)

**Comment:** Bruteforce seem to be the most popular solutions. However, very few test cases required efficiency, therefore, majority of marks are still achievable.

## Question 3: kth digit of nth Fibonacci number (easy, suppose to be medium)

### During contest
* Total submissions: 22
* Success rate: 22.7% (5/22)
	** Error count**
	* Wrong answers: 14 
	* Runtime error: 17
	* Terminate due to timeout: 1
* Fastest solver: kanishkalikhanna (+9min)
Languague used: Python3, Java8, Cpp14

### After contest
Total submission: 3
* Success rate: 0% (0/3)

**Comment:** This question is unfair for those not using python. As a non-frequent python user, I was not expect it (to existed) to be able to deal with massive number. From my perspective, I was expecting contestants to handle large number using array or some sort of data structures. I am very sorry for those who not using python.

## Question 4: influenced sum (hard)

### During contest
* Total submissions: 10
* Success rate: 10% (1/10)
	** Error count**
	* Wrong answers: 6
	* Runtime error: 3
	* Terminate due to timeout: 1
* Fastest solver: moxis (+47min)
Languague used: Python3, Cpp14

### After contest
Total submission: 4
* Success rate: 25% (1/4)

**Comment:** The testcase is unfair for those using python. Generated testcase is being test using cpp, therefore, there is a problem when getting the input in python regarding the empty space at the end of lines.
