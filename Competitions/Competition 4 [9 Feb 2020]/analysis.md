### After contest
* Total submussions: 8
* Success rate: 25% (2/8)

**Comment:** Bruteforce seem to be the most popular solution. However, very few test cases required efficiency, therefore, majority of marks were still achievable.

## Question 3: kth digit of nth Fibonacci number (easy, supposed to be medium)

* Success rate: 22.7% (5/22)
	* Wrong answers: 14 
	* Runtime error: 17
	* Terminate due to timeout (TLE): 1
* Fastest solver: kanishkalikhanna (+9min)
Languages used: Python3, Java8, Cpp14

### After contest
Total submission: 3
* Success rate: 0% (0/3)

**Comment:** This question was unfair for those not using python. As a non-frequent python user, I was not expecting it to be able to deal with large numbers (ie, those which exceed the limit of int). From my perspective, I was expecting contestants to handle large numbers using array or some sort of data structure. I am very sorry for those who not using python.

## Question 4: influenced sum (hard)

### During contest
* Total submissions: 10
* Number of users: 3
* Highest score: 250/250 (100%)
* Lowest score: 0/250 (0%)
* Mean: 157.45/250 (63%)
* Success rate: 10% (1/10)
	* Wrong answers: 6
	* Runtime error: 3
	* Terminate due to timeout (TLE): 1
* Fastest solver: moxis (+47min)
Languages used: Python3, Cpp14

### After contest
Total submission: 4
* Success rate: 25% (1/4)

**Comment:** The testcase is unfair for those using python. Generated testcase is being test using cpp, therefore, there is a problem when getting the input in python regarding the empty space at the end of lines.
