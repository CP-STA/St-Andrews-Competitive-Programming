# Contest 7 standings

**This is the official final scoreboard of the contest and the one on HackerRank is NOT valid.**

Due to one contestant getting full score on the cancelled Q3, we have had to regenerate the scoreboard, which HackerRank can't do. Hence the table below shows the corrected score of every candidate.
